## Usage

1. If your software environment is not ready, go check this [LaTeX installation document](https://mirror.macomnet.net/pub/CTAN/info/install-latex-guide-zh-cn/install-latex-guide-zh-cn.pdf) by *Wang Ran* or this [LaTeX tutorial by SUSTech](https://niko.cra.moe/uploads/short-url/9a47N0ThHXRb6em95R7422y8v7b.pdf).
2. Some basic LaTeX grammar rules are also included in the documents above. If you have any problem, Google it first and it always help.
3. Clone this repository and you can modify it!

Tips: The file format of the slides generated by LaTeX Beamer is `pdf`, thus sometimes incompatible with some courses' requirements of SDU, which requires `ppt / pptx` files most of the time. So give [pdf2pptx](https://github.com/intMojIBakE/pdf2pptx) or [BeamerStyleSlides](https://github.com/wzpan/BeamerStyleSlides) a try!

For Visual Studio Code users, if you prefer not to install `TeXstudio`, you can use the `LaTeX Workshop` extension to write LaTeX directly in VS Code.

Find and modify the following configurations in `Settings.json`:

```json
"latex-workshop.latex.tools": [
    {
        "name": "biber",
        "command": "biber",
        "args": [
            "%DOCFILE%"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "xelatex",
        "command": "xelatex",
        "args": [
            "-synctex=1",
            "-interaction=nonstopmode",
            "%DOC%"
        ],
    },
    ……
],

"latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
    {
        "name": "xelatex -> biber -> xelatex",
        "tools": [
            "xelatex",
            "biber",
            "xelatex",
        ]
    },
    ……
]
```

### Fonts

> Update 2025/03/03: Added to the fonts directory.
>
> 1. LXGW font. This project does not hold any copyright. Used according to <https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai#%E8%AE%B8%E5%8F%AF>
> 2. Arial font. Compiling with GitHub Actions implies acceptance of Microsoft's EULA for the use of Arial font. This project does not hold any copyright.
> 3. Sarasa Mono SC font. Repository address: <https://github.com/be5invis/Sarasa-Gothic>; this project does not hold any copyright.

At the beginning of `slide.tex`, there are the following configurations:

```latex
% 字体设置 / Font settings
\usepackage{fontspec} % 字体选择 / Font selection
\usepackage{xeCJK} % 中文字体支持 / Chinese font support

% 设置中文字体 / Set Chinese fonts
\setCJKsansfont[AutoFakeBold]{LXGW WenKai}
\setCJKmainfont{LXGW WenKai}
\setCJKmonofont{Sarasa Mono SC}

% 设置英文字体 / Set English fonts
\setmainfont{Times New Roman} % 主字体 / Main font
\setsansfont{Arial} % 无衬线字体 / Sans-serif font
```

You usually need to modify these settings according to your needs. If using Linux, you can view the installed fonts on your system with the `fc-list` command, or `fc-list :lang=zh` to find Chinese fonts.

## Overleaf Template

After some limited testing, this template is too large for Overleaf's free plan, which often results in long compilation times and system throttling. Therefore, consider building it locally or automatically with GitHub Actions. The automated build script is included in the repository.
